Asciidoc Macros used for DPMB
=============================

[asciidoctor-compat.conf](asciidoctor-compat.conf) has been downloaded
[from the compat subdirectory of the Asciidoctor project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/4c5404d865c6668a593d72d76791af676e43b8fa/compat/asciidoc.conf). Licensed

Since then some macro definitions have been updated to work with Python 3.
